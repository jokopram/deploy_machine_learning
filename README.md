This project demonstrates how to train and deploy a simple model. Using a pima indians diabetes dataset, I create a model that can predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Other applications can use this model through a single route server. This project is composed of two python files: a model training script and the web server.

# model
diabetes-classification-model.py trains and saves the model to the disk.

# server
server.py contains all the requiered for flask and to manage APIs.

# request
request.py contains the python code to process POST request to server.

# deploy model in pythonanywhere.com
I deployed machine learning model about diabetes prediction into pythonanywhere.com.
